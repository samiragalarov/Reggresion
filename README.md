# Regression Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Regression Analysis project repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques for regression analysis, exploring various models and methodologies to predict outcomes based on input features. The primary objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data and to develop accurate predictive models for future engineering or decision-making processes.

## Contents

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics.
   - Perform descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Select relevant features and create new ones to enhance model performance.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Compare and evaluate different regression algorithms.
   - Choose Gradient Boosting for its superior performance.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Optimize hyperparameters to ensure model generalizability.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

6. **Results:**
   - Discuss the insights gained from the analysis and the predictive capabilities of the chosen model.
